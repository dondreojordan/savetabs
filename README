Purpose:

Tabs are good for collecting information, but not for organizing. I am
looking for a way to save all open web pages into an external system
(A wiki document, e-mail, etc.)

The first version of the extension will convert the current window's
tabs into a list of titles and URLs in Markdown or JSON format.
